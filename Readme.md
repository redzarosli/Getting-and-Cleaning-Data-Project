The dataset comes from a study of wearable technology that records the
various activities of 30 users. The activity involves walking, running
and sleeping. The dataset analyzes numerous variables involved with
motion that can be captured by the wearable technology.

From the raw datasets, there were several processes and transformations
to get the dataset into the tidy format. The following processes
include:

1.  Merging the training and the test sets of activity, subject and the
    main body values to create one data set.
2.  Renaming the variables to make them more descriptive.
3.  Factor the activity variable to indicate the activity takng place
    for each observation.
4.  Extracting the data that is only mean and standard deviation.
5.  Creating a text file called tidy\_data.txt.
